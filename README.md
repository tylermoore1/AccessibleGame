This is a rendition of the game 2048. The objective is to stack two tiles with the same number so they add together. The goal of this game is to see if you can add enough tiles together to get 2048. Side note: we coded this entire game without any outside sources or help. This can be hard for someone with disabilities because they might have a hard time controlling their muscles when it comes to using the four arrow keys to control the tiles. We made this game accessible by eliminating the four buttons by just using one (switch control). Our program allows the user to use any key they want to, but to make a switch control program more realistic, we recommend using the space bar because it is the biggest button. 

Instructions: Click the space bar to change the direction of the arrow you want the tiles to move in. Once you have the direction you want, hold the space bar for up to 0.5 seconds and the tiles will move in that direction. It is simple yet just as effective as the real game.
